It sorts an array by repeatedly selecting the ****smallest (or largest)**** element from the unsorted portion and swapping it with the first unsorted element

# Process
1. Find the smallest element then swap it with the first position (gets the smallest number at position 0)
2. then repeatedly find the smallest in the remaining at bring it to position 1 
3. Continue

## Complexity Analysis
1. **Time Complexity: O(n********2********) ,as there are two nested loops:
2. Requires only a constant O(1) extra memory space
- Selection sort has a time complexity of O(n^2) makes it slower compared to other algo
