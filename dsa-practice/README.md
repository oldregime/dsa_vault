## 🎯 Goals
- **Master fundamentals**: Implement core DSA concepts from scratch
- **Dual-language proficiency**: Code solutions in both Java and Python
- **Problem-solving skills**: Practice with various algorithmic challenges
- **Code quality**: Write clean, well-documented, efficient code
- **Interview preparation**: Build a strong foundation for technical interviews

## 📚 Learning Approach
1. **Understand the concept** using notes from `dsa-knowledge-vault`
2. **Implement from scratch** in preferred language
3. **Optimize and refactor** for better performance
4. **Document learnings** and edge cases
5. **Practice variations** and related problems

## 🚀 Getting Started

### Prerequisites
- **Java**: JDK 11+ installed
- **Python**: Python 3.8+ installed
- **IDE**: VS Code, IntelliJ, or preferred editor

### Running Java Code
```bash
# Compile and run
javac ClassName.java
java ClassName

# Note: Package declarations have been removed from Java files for simplicity
# To run any Java file, navigate to its directory and use the commands above
```

### Running Python Code
```bash
# Direct execution
python3 filename.py

# Or make executable
chmod +x filename.py
./filename.py
```
