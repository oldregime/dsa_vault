## 📖 Overview

This repository represents my comprehensive journey in learning Data Structures and Algorithms. It combines theoretical knowledge management with practical coding practice through a dual-repository system designed for maximum learning efficiency and retention.

### 🎯 Learning Philosophy
- **Knowledge-First Approach**: Deep understanding before implementation
- **Spaced Repetition**: Using Anki cards for long-term retention
- **Multi-Language Practice**: Implementing concepts in both Java and Python
- **Systematic Organization**: Structured knowledge base for easy reference
- **Progress Tracking**: Data-driven learning with metrics and goals
